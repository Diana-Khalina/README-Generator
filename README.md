## Description

  Every good project needs a quality README with information about the project - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.
This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project. 

While completing the challenge I used YouTube Lessons from Anton Scheving https://www.youtube.com/@AntonScheving/videos









## Installation

To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local machine so you have the Node project on your local.
Run npm install 
Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.
After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'README.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.









## Usage

When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.
The application then takes your responses and will generate README.md file.  Finally, fs.writeFile is used to generate your project's README.md file. 









## Contribution

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.









## Test

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
